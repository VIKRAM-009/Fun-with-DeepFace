Welcome to **FunWithDeepFace**, a collection of AI-powered facial analysis applications using the **DeepFace** library. This repository contains multiple Streamlit-based apps for various face-related tasks, including **age prediction, gender detection, race classification, facial filters, and more**.

## 📌 Features
- **Age Prediction** 🧓👶 – Predicts the age of a person from an image.
- **Gender Detection** 👨👩 – Determines the gender of the person in an image.
- **Race/Ethnicity Classification** 🌎 – Identifies the ethnicity of a person.
- **Face Recognition** 📸 – Compares and verifies two faces for similarity.
- **AI-Powered Face Filters** 🎭 – Applies fun filters and beautification effects to faces.

## 🚀 Installation
To run the apps locally, follow these steps:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VIKRAM-009/Fun-with-DeepFace.git
cd Fun-with-DeepFace
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run a Specific App
Each app is inside its respective folder (e.g., `age`, `gender`, etc.). Navigate to the folder and run:
```bash
cd age
streamlit run app.py
```
Replace `age` with `gender`, `race`, `filter`, etc., to run other apps.
## ⚡ Usage
- Upload an image using the Streamlit interface.
- The model processes the image and provides predictions.
- Results are displayed with confidence scores and visualizations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **DeepFace** – Facial recognition and analysis
- **OpenCV** – Image processing
- **Streamlit** – Web interface for easy interaction
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch** – Model training and inference

## 📌 To-Do List
- [ ] Add real-time webcam support
- [ ] Improve UI with Streamlit components
- [ ] Deploy on cloud services
